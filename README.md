# RSA Encryption and Decryption - Network Security Assignment

## Introduction

This implementation demonstrates the RSA encryption and decryption algorithm implemented in Python using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using RSA, view key details, and optionally input custom keys for encryption and decryption.

## Features

- Generate RSA keys using randomly chosen primes from a file.
- Encrypt plain text messages into a list of integers.
- Decrypt encrypted integers back into the original message.
- GUI built with Tkinter for user interaction.
- Option to view the RSA key components (p, q, n, Ï†(n), e, d).

## Files Included

- `rsa.py` - Main Python file containing the full implementation.
- `primes-to-100k.txt` - List of prime numbers used for key generation.
- `output.md` - Describes output with screenshots.
- `report.docx` - Report of the implementation
- Screenshots folder - Contains example encryption/decryption screenshots.
